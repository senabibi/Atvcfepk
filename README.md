Corporate-Vulnerability-Management-System
The corporate vulnerability database system manages the company's previous vulnerabilities and attacks, which can only be accessed by authorized personnel, and provides detailed information (description, change history, references to solutions and tools, known affected software configuration, and weakness enumeration) about these risks which can be obtained through the CVE number, while details about new publicly released attacks can also be found.

System can be used with MITRE's CVE records in .txt format.
