     The ATVCFEPK project, developed by SentSecPro, is a database system that manages the company's past vulnerabilities and attacks. Authorized personnel can access detailed information via CVE numbers and also receive information about newly disclosed public attacks. However, it lacks features for recovering forgotten login credentials or tracking user activity. While the system fulfills its purpose of providing information about vulnerabilities and attacks, there are opportunities for improvement.

## About The Project

<div style="justify-content: center; ">
  <img src="images/1.png" alt="pic" width="800" height="600">
</div>
The ATVCFEPK project, developed using C++ by SentSecPro, is a substantial and innovative venture that addresses the ever-growing importance of cybersecurity. This project serves as a comprehensive Corporate Vulnerability Management System, meticulously designed to manage the company's historical vulnerabilities and attacks. It offers authorized personnel access to in-depth information through the use of CVE numbers, while also providing insights into newly disclosed public attacks.


In this system, data is organized and stored efficiently, enabling a structured approach to understanding and addressing vulnerabilities and cyber threats. The project's architecture leverages the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for enhanced code organization, modularity, and maintainability. With its sophisticated design, it aids in safeguarding critical information assets.

While the project excels in delivering valuable insights about past vulnerabilities and attacks, it acknowledges the potential for enhancement in terms of features such as password recovery and user activity tracking. Despite these opportunities for improvement, the Corporate Vulnerability Management System within the ATVCFEPK project remains a valuable tool for managing and safeguarding data in an increasingly challenging cyber landscape.

This project, with its focus on cybersecurity and its utilization of OOP principles, embodies a commitment to enhancing corporate security in an age where cyber threats continue to evolve and pose a significant risk.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. Please follow these steps to get your environment ready.

### Prerequisites

Before you start with the C++ and OOP Security Attacks project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* [C++ Compiler](https://cpp.sh/): You'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run the C++ code used in this project. If you don't have one, you can install a compiler like g++ or Visual C++.

* [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Knowledge](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp): Familiarity with Object-Oriented Programming concepts is essential for understanding and working with the code. Make sure you have a good grasp of OOP principles.

* [Security Basics](https://www.cdse.edu/Training/eLearning/IS122/): A fundamental understanding of cybersecurity and common security threats is crucial. Ensure you have a basic knowledge of security concepts to effectively address security attacks.

* Code Editor/IDE: Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that you're comfortable with for writing and running C++ code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks.

* Libraries and Dependencies: Depending on the specific security attacks you plan to study, you may need additional libraries and dependencies. Be prepared to install and configure these components as needed.

* Sample Data: If your project involves analyzing security attack data, make sure you have access to relevant datasets or sample data files.

Having these prerequisites in place will ensure a smooth and productive experience while working on the C++ and OOP Security Attacks project, where you'll explore the world of cybersecurity through the lens of C++ and OOP.
