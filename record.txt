Exponent CMS 2.4 uses PHP reflection to call a method of a controller
class, and then uses the method name to check user permission. But,
the method name in PHP reflection is case insensitive, and Exponent
CMS permits undefined actions to execute by default, so an attacker
can use a capitalized method name to bypass the permission check,
e.g., controller=expHTMLEditor&action=preview&editor=ckeditor and
controller=expHTMLEditor&action=Preview&editor=ckeditor. An anonymous
user will be rejected for the former but can access the latter.

A vulnerability in the data plane IP fragment handler of the Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) CX Context-Aware Security module
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the CX module
to be unable to process further traffic, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling
of IP fragments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted fragmented IP traffic across the CX module. An exploit
could allow the attacker to exhaust free packet buffers in shared
memory (SHM), causing the CX module to be unable to process further
traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects all
versions of the ASA CX Context-Aware Security module. Cisco has not
released and will not release software updates that address this
vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this
vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva62946.

A hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability was identified in Red
Lion Controls Sixnet-Managed Industrial Switches running firmware
Version 5.0.196 and Stride-Managed Ethernet Switches running firmware
Version 5.0.190. Vulnerable versions of Stride-Managed Ethernet
switches and Sixnet-Managed Industrial switches use hard-coded HTTP
SSL/SSH keys for secure communication. Because these keys cannot be
regenerated by users, all products use the same key. The attacker
could disrupt communication or compromise the system. CVSS v3 base
score: 10, CVSS vector string: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
Red Lion Controls recommends updating to SLX firmware Version 5.3.174.

Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are
vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a
local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is
delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was
delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to
download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows
would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML
document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed.

WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV
COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a
read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to
modify existing files.

Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before
9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass.
Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB
authentication component that allows authenticating users against an
SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect
to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The
backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any
kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers
nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an
account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled
by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud
config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're
not affected by this vulnerability.

Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper
authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as
implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users
and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to
unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The
previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in
the group.

Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element
Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on
a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not
filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the
system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when
an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore
been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are
required to create users within Revive Adserver.

On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the
local SYSTEM account or another administrator account in order to
enable full functionality of the agent. The typical configuration is
for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM
account. The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and
executables on the endpoint in order to gather and report information
about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The
SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as
needed from the CounterACT management appliance and runs them on the
endpoint. The SecureConnector agent fails to set any permissions on
downloaded file objects. This allows a malicious user to take
ownership of any of these files and make modifications to it,
regardless of where the files are saved. These files are then executed
under SYSTEM privileges. A malicious unprivileged user can overwrite
these executable files with malicious code before the SecureConnector
agent executes them, causing the malicious code to be run under the
SYSTEM account.

possible to change this directory by setting the the configuration

unauthenticated attacker is able to access the URL
/servlet/MenuHandlerServlet, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. The
attacker could extract users' password hashes, which are MD5 hashes
without salt, and, depending on the database type and its
configuration, could also execute operating system commands using SQL
queries.

The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote
Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative
interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php
(/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and
unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't
properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip'
and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows
for system commands to be injected into the device. The code
erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by
utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the
case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.

The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version
4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in
its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in
MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the
component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX
wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information
passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class
function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec()
with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The
page that contains the vulnerabilities,
/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command
answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to
that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is:
'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell
access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.

In BMC Patrol before 9.13.10.02, the binary "listguests64" is
configured with the setuid bit. However, when executing it, it will
look for a binary named "virsh" using the PATH environment variable.
The "listguests64" program will then run "virsh" using root
privileges. This allows local users to elevate their privileges to
root.

The regex code in Webkit 2.4.11 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) as demonstrated in a large
number of ($ (open parenthesis and dollar) followed by {-2,16} and a
large number of +) (plus close parenthesis).

The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the
Linux kernel 4.4.22 through 4.4.28 contains extended asm statements
that are incompatible with the exception table, which allows local
users to obtain root access on non-SMEP platforms via a crafted
application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of incorrect
backporting of the CVE-2016-9178 patch to older kernels.

vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities in its web

diagnostics CGI (/cgi-bin/diagnostics) component responsible for
emailing out information about the state of the system. The
application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the
'tsrDeleteRestartedFile' or 'currentTSREmailTo' variables before

The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is
vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web
administrative interface. This vulnerability occurs in the
'extensionsettings' CGI (/cgi-bin/extensionsettings) component
responsible for handling some of the server's internal configurations.
The CGI application doesn't properly escape the information it's
passed when processing a particular multi-part form request involving
scripts. The filename of the 'scriptname' variable is read in
unsanitized before a call to system() is performed - allowing for
remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields
shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account. This

QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the ColdFire Fast Ethernet
Controller emulator support is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue.
It could occur while receiving packets in 'mcf_fec_receive'. A
privileged user/process inside guest could use this issue to crash the
QEMU process on the host leading to DoS.

KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.8.12, when I/O APIC is enabled, does
not properly restrict the VCPU index, which allows guest OS users to
gain host OS privileges or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
array access and host OS crash) via a crafted interrupt request,
related to arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.c and arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.h.

An error in handling certain queries can cause an assertion failure
when a server is using the nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone
for which it is also providing authoritative service. A vulnerable
server could be intentionally stopped by an attacker if it was using a
configuration that met the criteria for the vulnerability and if the
attacker could cause it to accept a query that possessed the required
attributes. Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-
redirect" feature, which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN
redirection, and is only available in certain versions of BIND.
Redirection using zones of type "redirect" is not affected by this
vulnerability. Affects BIND 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S3, 9.9.9-S1 ->
9.9.9-S6, 9.11.0-9.11.0-P1.

The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel
before 4.8.14 mishandles negative values of sk_sndbuf and sk_rcvbuf,
which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for a crafted setsockopt
system call with the (1) SO_SNDBUFFORCE or (2) SO_RCVBUFFORCE option.

Alcatel-Lucent OmniVista 8770 2.0 through 3.0 exposes different ORBs
interfaces, which can be queried using the GIOP protocol on TCP port
30024. An attacker can bypass authentication, and OmniVista invokes
methods (AddJobSet, AddJob, and ExecuteNow) that can be used to run
arbitrary commands on the server, with the privilege of NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the server. NOTE: The discoverer states "The
vendor position is to refer to the technical guidelines of the product
security deployment to mitigate this issue, which means applying
proper firewall rules to prevent unauthorised clients to connect to

Reference: MISC:http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Jun/4

An XSS vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
client side script on vulnerable installations of Sophos Cyberoam
firewall devices with firmware through 10.6.4. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists
within the handling of a request to the "LiveConnectionDetail.jsp"
application. GET parameters "applicationname" and "username" are
improperly sanitized allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary
JavaScript into the page. This can be abused by an attacker to perform
a cross-site scripting attack on the user. A vulnerable URI is
/corporate/webpages/trafficdiscovery/LiveConnectionDetail.jsp.

The file scanning mechanism of JFilterInput::isFileSafe() in Joomla!
CMS before 3.6.5 does not consider alternative PHP file extensions
when checking uploaded files for PHP content, which enables a user to
upload and execute files with the `.php6`, `.php7`, `.phtml`, and
`.phpt` extensions. Additionally, JHelperMedia::canUpload() did not
blacklist these file extensions as uploadable file types.

An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. When the user does not specify
a blowfish_secret key for encrypting cookies, phpMyAdmin generates one
at runtime. A vulnerability was reported where the way this value is
created uses a weak algorithm. This could allow an attacker to
determine the user's blowfish_secret and potentially decrypt their
cookies. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to
4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.

An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before 3.2.10,
4.1.x before 4.1.4, and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. Spring Security does not
consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By
adding a URL path parameter with an encoded "/" to a request, an
attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause
of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path
parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers
include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and
some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo()
as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints.
The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to
be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat (all current versions) are not
affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance
previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path
parameters from the value returned by getContextPath(),
getServletPath(), and getPathInfo(). Users of other Servlet containers
based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether
or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM
WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x are known to be affected. Users of
other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be
affected.

The php_wddx_push_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before
5.6.29 and 7.x before 7.0.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (out-of-bounds read and memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via an empty boolean element in a wddxPacket
XML document.

An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x
before 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is
received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated
using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call
itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly
handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the
endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not
require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for
chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still
processed and the crash occurs.

An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 11.x before 11.25.1,
13.x before 13.13.1, and 14.x before 14.2.1 and Certified Asterisk
11.x before 11.6-cert16 and 13.x before 13.8-cert4. The chan_sip
channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting
to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character.
Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and
horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as
if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\x01:
will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a
problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP
proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To
headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk
without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog
request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will
look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then
process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can
process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you
do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect
you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track
of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect
you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does
not affect you.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/12/12/7

Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its
ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block
based on the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough
content octets in the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and
the memory block will be zeroed even if its unused. There is a
noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.

RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be
ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes
of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-
descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can
lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the
process is fully placed inside the container.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way affected
Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in
Microsoft browsers. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such
a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of
the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take
control of an affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. This vulnerability is different from those described

Twitter Kit for iOS versions 3.0 to 3.2.1 is vulnerable to a callback
verification flaw in the "Login with Twitter" component allowing an
attacker to provide alternate credentials. In the final step of "Login
with Twitter" authentication information is passed back to the
application using the registered custom URL scheme (typically
twitterkit-<consumer-key>) on iOS. Because the callback handler did
not verify the authenticity of the response, this step is vulnerable
to forgery, potentially allowing attacker to associate a Twitter
account with a third-party service.

When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a
feature that outputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers.
The code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or
the application's provide callback), which could lead to other private
data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer
was an uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it
turned out to not contain any zero byte, it would continue and display
the data following that buffer in memory.

When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that
contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file
name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer
size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length. This too
large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to
send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto()
function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A
malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using
client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which
protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory
contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols
with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.

curl supports "globbing" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical
range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of
transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range,
there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the
URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The
URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to
wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL
that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.

Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are
set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches
containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in
Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and
editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API did not check
the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub
organization folder was created via Blue Ocean, it retained a
reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allowed users with
read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary
commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization
corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub
credentials of the creator of the organization folder. Additionally,
users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could read
arbitrary file contents from the repositories inside the GitHub
organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder if the
branch contained a Jenkinsfile (which could be created using the other
part of this vulnerability), and they could provide the organization
folder name, repository name, branch name, and file name.

is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a
socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in
packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with
PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the
update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further.
As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in
the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any
process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.

Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path
switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data()
calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send()
calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which
leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU,
copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and
the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation
and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can
exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become
negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds.
A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in
e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18

Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with
https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86
(committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in
April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86
(backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized
as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE
enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy,
load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address
range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_
binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient
space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD
segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD
segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that
is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP.
When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in
(anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with
the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response
containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is
then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string
parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but
without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a
trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would
then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap
buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it
was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and
effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD
command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a
high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue
remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD
responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit
of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit
[415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March
2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the
string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final
double quote.

On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process
can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel
will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the
signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception
entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack,
allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary
values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if
panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written.
This flaw was introduced in commit: "5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable
transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)" which was merged
upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.

An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data,
in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes,
libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the
size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data
function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the
data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based
buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond
the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then
deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.

Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier
are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An
unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers
to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins
CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`,
bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're
fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're
also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS
2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization)
CLI protocol, disabling it by default.

Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier
are vulnerable to a login command which allowed impersonating any
Jenkins user. The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI
stored the encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user

a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt
them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards.
Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from

Exim supports the use of multiple "-p" command line arguments which
are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other
issues allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This
affects exim version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time

The offset2lib patch as used in the Linux Kernel contains a
vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to be execve()'ed with 1GB of
arguments or environmental strings then the stack occupies the address
0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above 0x40000000 nullifying
the protection of the offset2lib patch. This affects Linux Kernel
version 4.11.5 and earlier. This is a different issue than
CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based

The offset2lib patch as used by the Linux Kernel contains a
vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK is set to RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte
of memory is allocated (the maximum under the 1/4 restriction) then
the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as the PIE binary is
mapped above 0x80000000 the minimum distance between the end of the
PIE binary's read-write segment and the start of the stack becomes
small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an
attacker. This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a
different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue

The OpenBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an
attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that
causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows
attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate
stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This
affects OpenBSD 6.1 and possibly earlier versions.

libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily
trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note
that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously
stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be
incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was
vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in
version 3.1.

master home directory. These credentials were stored unencrypted,
allowing anyone with local file system access to access them.
Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text as
part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The Linux Kernel versions 2.6.38 through 4.14 have a problematic use
of pmd_mkdirty() in the touch_pmd() function inside the THP
implementation. touch_pmd() can be reached by get_user_pages(). In
such case, the pmd will become dirty. This scenario breaks the new
can_follow_write_pmd()'s logic - pmd can become dirty without going
through a COW cycle. This bug is not as severe as the original "Dirty
cow" because an ext4 file (or any other regular file) cannot be mapped
using THP. Nevertheless, it does allow us to overwrite read-only huge
pages. For example, the zero huge page and sealed shmem files can be
overwritten (since their mapping can be populated using THP). Note
that after the first write page-fault to the zero page, it will be
replaced with a new fresh (and zeroed) thp.

The Linux kernel version 3.3-rc1 and later is affected by a
vulnerability lies in the processing of incoming L2CAP commands -
ConfigRequest, and ConfigResponse messages. This info leak is a result
of uninitialized stack variables that may be returned to an attacker
in their uninitialized state. By manipulating the code flows that
precede the handling of these configuration messages, an attacker can
also gain some control over which data will be held in the
uninitialized stack variables. This can allow him to bypass KASLR, and
stack canaries protection - as both pointers and stack canaries may be
leaked in this manner. Combining this vulnerability (for example) with
the previously disclosed RCE vulnerability in L2CAP configuration
parsing (CVE-2017-1000251) may allow an attacker to exploit the RCE
against kernels which were built with the above mitigations. These are
the specifics of this vulnerability: In the function
l2cap_parse_conf_rsp and in the function l2cap_parse_conf_req the
following variable is declared without initialization: struct
l2cap_conf_efs efs; In addition, when parsing input configuration
parameters in both of these functions, the switch case for handling
EFS elements may skip the memcpy call that will write to the efs
variable: ... case L2CAP_CONF_EFS: if (olen == sizeof(efs))
memcpy(&efs, (void *)val, olen); ... The olen in the above if is
attacker controlled, and regardless of that if, in both of these
functions the efs variable would eventually be added to the outgoing
configuration request that is being built: l2cap_add_conf_opt(&ptr,
L2CAP_CONF_EFS, sizeof(efs), (unsigned long) &efs); So by sending a
configuration request, or response, that contains an L2CAP_CONF_EFS
element, but with an element length that is not sizeof(efs) - the
memcpy to the uninitialized efs variable can be avoided, and the
uninitialized variable would be returned to the attacker (16 bytes).

Reference: URL:http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q1/52

OpenFlow Plugin and OpenDayLight Controller versions Nitrogen, Carbon,
Boron, Robert Varga, Anil Vishnoi contain a flaw when multiple
'expired' flows take up the memory resource of CONFIG DATASTORE which
leads to CONTROLLER shutdown. If multiple different flows with 'idle-
timeout' and 'hard-timeout' are sent to the Openflow Plugin REST API,
the expired flows will eventually crash the controller once its
resource allocations set with the JVM size are exceeded. Although the
installed flows (with timeout set) are removed from network (and thus
also from controller's operations DS), the expired entries are still
present in CONFIG DS. The attack can originate both from NORTH or
SOUTH. The above description is for a north bound attack. A south
bound attack can originate when an attacker attempts a flow flooding
attack and since flows come with timeouts, the attack is not
successful. However, the attacker will now be successful in CONTROLLER
overflow attack (resource consumption). Although, the network (actual
flow tables) and operational DS are only (~)1% occupied, the
controller requests for resource consumption. This happens because the
installed flows get removed from the network upon timeout.

Reference: MISC:https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20171128/open-redirection-on-login-form

When you visit a page where you need to login, Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 sends
you to the login form with a 'came_from' parameter set to the previous
url. After you login, you get redirected to the page you tried to view
before. An attacker might try to abuse this by letting you click on a
specially crafted link. You would login, and get redirected to the
site of the attacker, letting you think that you are still on the
original Plone site. Or some javascript of the attacker could be
executed. Most of these types of attacks are already blocked by Plone,
using the `isURLInPortal` check to make sure we only redirect to a
page on the same Plone site. But a few more ways of tricking Plone
into accepting a malicious link were discovered, and fixed with this
hotfix.

By linking to a specific url in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 with a parameter, an
attacker could send you to his own website. On its own this is not so
bad: the attacker could more easily link directly to his own website
instead. But in combination with another attack, you could be sent to
the Plone login form and login, then get redirected to the specific
url, and then get a second redirect to the attacker website. (The
specific url can be seen by inspecting the hotfix code, but we don't
want to make it too easy for attackers by spelling it out here.)

In Jenkins Script Security Plugin version 1.36 and earlier, users with
the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy scripts are able to use a
type coercion feature in Groovy to create new `File` objects from
strings. This allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins master

A specific device configuration can result in a commit failure
condition. When this occurs, a user is logged in without being
prompted for a password while trying to login through console, ssh,
ftp, telnet or su, etc., This issue relies upon a device configuration
precondition to occur. Typically, device configurations are the result
of a trusted administrative change to the system's running
configuration. The following error messages may be seen when this
failure occurs: mgd: error: commit failed: (statements constraint
check failed) Warning: Commit failed, activating partial
configuration. Warning: Edit the router configuration to fix these
errors. If the administrative changes are not made that result in such
a failure, then this issue is not seen. No other Juniper Networks
products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases
are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 prior to 12.3R10, 12.3R11; 12.3X48

On all vSRX and SRX Series devices, when the DHCP or DHCP relay is
configured, specially crafted packet might cause the flowd process to
crash, halting or interrupting traffic from flowing through the
device(s). Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an
extended denial of service condition for the device(s). If the device
is configured in high-availability, the RG1+ (data-plane) will fail-
over to the secondary node. If the device is configured in stand-
alone, there will be temporary traffic interruption until the flowd
process is restored automatically. Sustained crafted packets may cause
the secondary failover node to fail back, or fail completely,
potentially halting flowd on both nodes of the cluster or causing
flip-flop failovers to occur. No other Juniper Networks products or
platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper
Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67 on vSRX or SRX Series;
12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50 on vSRX or SRX Series; 15.1X49 prior to

Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1, and services releases based off of
16.1R1, are vulnerable to the receipt of a crafted BGP Protocol Data
Unit (PDU) sent directly to the router, which can cause the RPD
routing process to crash and restart. Unlike BGP UPDATEs, which are
transitive in nature, this issue can only be triggered by a packet
sent directly to the IP address of the router. Repeated crashes of the
rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. This
issue only affects devices running Junos OS 16.1R1 and services
releases based off of 16.1R1 (e.g. 16.1R1-S1, 16.1R1-S2, 16.1R1-S3).
No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this vulnerability, and
this issue was resolved in Junos OS 16.2 prior to 16.2R1. No other
Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.

Any Juniper Networks SRX series device with one or more ALGs enabled
may experience a flowd crash when traffic is processed by the Sun/MS-
RPC ALGs. This vulnerability in the Sun/MS-RPC ALG services component
of Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a repeated denial of service

flip-flop failure operations or full failure to the flowd daemon
halting traffic on all nodes. Only IPv6 traffic is affected by this
issue. IPv4 traffic is unaffected. This issues is not seen with to-
host traffic. This issue has no relation with HA services themselves,
only the ALG service. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms
are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks

In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14rc0, there are multiple heap use after
free vulnerabilities in the tool nasm. The related heap is allocated
in the token() function and freed in the detoken() function (called by
pp_getline()) - it is used again at multiple positions later that
could cause multiple damages. For example, it causes a corrupted
double-linked list in detoken(), a double free or corruption in
delete_Token(), and an out-of-bounds write in detoken(). It has a high
possibility to lead to a remote code execution attack.

Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in
the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that any malicious user
connecting to the device can change the default SSID and password
thereby denying the owner an access to his/her own device. This device
acts as an Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various
industrial systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases
in the medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a
human being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker
to get access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might
allow them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in
case of nation critical infrastructure/industries.

Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in
the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that the desktop
application used to connect to the device suffers from a stack
overflow if more than 26 characters are passed to it as the Wi-Fi
name. This application is installed on the device and an attacker who
can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system
directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get
access to all the data that the user has access too. The application
uses a dynamic link library(DLL) called "avilib.dll" which is used by
the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to
control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change
password in the function "sendchangename" which allows a user to
change the Wi-Fi name on the device. This function calls a sub
function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x758784F8. The function determines
which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The
"sendchangename" passes the datastring as the second argument which is
the name we enter in the textbox and integer 1 as first argument. The
rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0. The function "sub_75876EA0" at
address 0x75876F19 uses the first argument received and to determine
which block to jump to. Since the argument passed is 1, it jumps to
0x75876F20 and proceeds from there to address 0x75876F56 which
calculates the length of the data string passed as the first
parameter. This length and the first argument are then passed to the
address 0x75877001 which calls the memmove function which uses a stack
address as the destination where the password typed by us is passed as
the source and length calculated above is passed as the number of
bytes to copy which leads to a stack overflow.

Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in
the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that an attacker
connected to the device Wi-Fi SSID can exploit a memory corruption
issue and execute remote code on the device. This device acts as an
Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various industrial
systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases in the
medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a human
being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get
access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might allow
them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in case of
nation critical infrastructure/industries. The firmware contains
binary uvc_stream that is the UDP daemon which is responsible for
handling all the UDP requests that the device receives. The client
application sends a UDP request to change the Wi-Fi name which
contains the following format: "SETCMD0001+0001+[2 byte length of
wifiname]+[Wifiname]. This request is handled by "control_Dev_thread"
function which at address "0x00409AE0" compares the incoming request
and determines if the 10th byte is 01 and if it is then it redirects
to 0x0040A74C which calls the function "setwifiname". The function
"setwifiname" uses a memcpy function but uses the length of the
payload obtained by using strlen function as the third parameter which
is the number of bytes to copy and this allows an attacker to overflow
the function and control the $PC value.

In FreeBSD 10.x before 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and
10.3-RELEASE-p24 named paths are globally scoped, meaning a process
located in one jail can read and modify the content of POSIX shared
memory objects created by a process in another jail or the host
system. As a result, a malicious user that has access to a jailed
system is able to abuse shared memory by injecting malicious content
in the shared memory region. This memory region might be executed by
applications trusting the shared memory, like Squid. This issue could
lead to a Denial of Service or local privilege escalation.

Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services
with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names
in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In
_krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from
the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted
version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an
opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks.
NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed
Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part
of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.

An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For
authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512
without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure
secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the
hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table
attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.

An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The
logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an
attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of
service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-
controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no
secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should
be deleted.

An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for
Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It
uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages.
However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but
transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the
private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of
the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too.
Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the
transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the
communication.

Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in
gsm-xsmp-server.c in old versions of gnome-session up until version
2.29.92 allows a local attacker to establish ICE connections to gnome-
session with invalid authentication data (an invalid magic cookie).
Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in
gnome-session. When the maximum number of file descriptors is
exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter an infinite loop
trying to communicate without success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The
graphical session associated with the gnome-session process will stop
working correctly, because communication with gnome-session is no

of adminservercacertdetails.cgi is reflected in the application's
response and is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject
tags. An attacker could come up with clever payloads to make the
system run commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, nslookup, arp,
etc.

Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has Reflected XSS in launchHelp.cgi. The
helpLaunchPage parameter is reflected in an IFRAME element, if the
value contains two quotes. It properly sanitizes quotes and tags, so
one cannot simply close the src with a quote and inject after that.
However, an attacker can use javascript: or data: to abuse this.

An issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player 27.0.0.183 and earlier
versions. This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that
reads data that is past the end of the target buffer due to an integer
overflow; the computation is part of the abstraction that creates an
arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap image. The use of an
invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data
structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can
lead to sensitive data exposure.

An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon
Security Appliance before 03.2.00. An incomplete firmware signature
allows a local attacker to upgrade the equipment (kernel, file system)
with unsigned, attacker-controlled, data. This occurs because the
appliance_config file is signed but the .tar.sec file is unsigned.

In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in
`HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded
public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be
allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC
KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables
symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the
PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft
JWTs from scratch.

In the most recent firmware for Blipcare, the device provides an open

user connects to this open Wireless network and uses the web
management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi
credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet

used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an
attacker who is in vicinity of Wireless signal generated by the
Blipcare device to easily sniff the credentials. Also, an attacker can
connect to the open wireless network "Blip" exposed by the device and
modify the HTTP response presented to the user by the device to
execute other attacks such as convincing the user to download and
execute a malicious binary that would infect a user's computer or

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Blipcare_sec_issues.pdf

Blipcare Wifi blood pressure monitor BP700 10.1 devices allow memory
corruption that results in Denial of Service. When connected to the
"Blip" open wireless connection provided by the device, if a large
string is sent as a part of the HTTP request in any part of the HTTP
headers, the device could become completely unresponsive. Presumably
this happens as the memory footprint provided to this device is very
small. According to the specs from Rezolt, the Wi-Fi module only has
256k of memory. As a result, an incorrect string copy operation using
either memcpy, strcpy, or any of their other variants could result in
filling up the memory space allocated to the function executing and
this would result in memory corruption. To test the theory, one can
modify the demo application provided by the Cypress WICED SDK and
introduce an incorrect "memcpy" operation and use the compiled
application on the evaluation board provided by Cypress semiconductors
with exactly the same Wi-Fi SOC. The results were identical where the
device would completely stop responding to any of the ping or web
requests.

In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the
TIFFOpen function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of service
attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked.
The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input
file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the
_TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set
the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it
will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.

MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded credentials that are used for
customer database access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded
credentials and the ability to communicate directly with the database
may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial
information. Connex utilizes an IBM i DB2 user account for database
access. The account name is HMSCXPDN. Its password is hard-coded in
multiple places in the application. Customers do not have the option
to change this password. The account has elevated DB2 roles, and can
access all objects or database tables on the customer DB2 database.
This account can access data through ODBC, FTP, and TELNET. Customers
without Connex installed are still vulnerable because the MEDHOST
setup program creates this account.

An XSS issue was discovered in admin/install.php in MantisBT before
1.3.12 and 2.x before 2.5.2. Some variables under user control in the
MantisBT installation script are not properly sanitized before being
output, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code,
as demonstrated by the $f_database, $f_db_username, and
$f_admin_username variables. This is mitigated by the fact that the
admin/ folder should be deleted after installation, and also prevented
by CSP.

A flaw was found in Ansible Tower's interface before 3.1.5 and 3.2.0
with SCM repositories. If a Tower project (SCM repository) definition
does not have the 'delete before update' flag set, an attacker with
commit access to the upstream playbook source repository could create
a Trojan playbook that, when executed by Tower, modifies the checked
out SCM repository to add git hooks. These git hooks could, in turn,
cause arbitrary command and code execution as the user Tower runs as.

Downstream version 1.0.46-1 of pure-ftpd as shipped in Fedora was
vulnerable to packaging error due to which the original configuration
was ignored after update and service started running with default
configuration. This has security implications because of overriding
security-related configuration. This issue doesn't affect upstream
version of pure-ftpd.

PostgreSQL 10.x before 10.1, 9.6.x before 9.6.6, 9.5.x before 9.5.10,
9.4.x before 9.4.15, 9.3.x before 9.3.20, and 9.2.x before 9.2.24 runs
under a non-root operating system account, and database superusers
have effective ability to run arbitrary code under that system
account. PostgreSQL provides a script for starting the database server
during system boot. Packages of PostgreSQL for many operating systems
provide their own, packager-authored startup implementations. Several
implementations use a log file name that the database superuser can
replace with a symbolic link. As root, they open(), chmod() and/or
chown() this log file name. This often suffices for the database
superuser to escalate to root privileges when root starts the server.

The bio_map_user_iov and bio_unmap_user functions in block/bio.c in
the Linux kernel before 4.13.8 do unbalanced refcounting when a SCSI
I/O vector has small consecutive buffers belonging to the same page.
The bio_add_pc_page function merges them into one, but the page
reference is never dropped. This causes a memory leak and possible
system lockup (exploitable against the host OS by a guest OS user, if
a SCSI disk is passed through to a virtual machine) due to an out-of-
memory condition.

A flaw was found in the CloudForms account configuration when using
VMware. By default, a shared account is used that has privileged
access to VMRC (VMWare Remote Console) functions that may not be
appropriate for users of CloudForms (and thus this account). An
attacker could use this vulnerability to view and make changes to
settings in the VMRC and virtual machines controlled by it that they
should not have access to.

A vulnerability in the dynamic access control list (ACL) feature of
Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches
could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause dynamic ACL
assignment to fail and the port to fail open. This could allow the
attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected port. The
vulnerability is due to an uncaught error condition that may occur
during the reassignment of the auth-default-ACL dynamic ACL to a
switch port after 802.1x authentication fails. A successful exploit of
this issue could allow a physically adjacent attacker to bypass 802.1x
authentication and cause the affected port to fail open, allowing the
attacker to pass traffic to the default VLAN of the affected switch
port. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc72751.

authenticated, local attacker to retrieve user profile information
from the affected software, which could lead to the disclosure of
confidential information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input
and validation checks in the affected software. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by authenticating locally to an affected
system and then issuing specific commands to the affected software. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to view all profile
information for a user instead of only certain Jabber parameters that
should be visible. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco
Jabber prior to Release 1.9.31. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve52418.

A vulnerability exists in the process of creating default IP blocks
during device initialization for Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall
Services that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send
traffic to the local IP address of the device, bypassing any filters
that are configured to deny local IP management traffic. The
vulnerability is due to an implementation error that exists in the
process of creating default IP blocks when the device is initialized,
and the way in which those IP blocks interact with user-configured
filters for local IP management traffic (for example, SSH to the
device). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
traffic to the local IP address of the targeted device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to connect to the local IP address of
the device even when there are filters configured to deny the traffic.

A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet
Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload,
resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially
corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network
instability. The vulnerability exists due to changes in the
implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft
between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast
Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update
packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length
field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP
session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause
the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either
outcome would result in a DoS. The vulnerability may be triggered when
the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing
BGP session. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE
Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN
configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not
vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCui67191, CSCvg52875.

A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration
products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized,
elevated access to an affected device. The vulnerability occurs when a
refresh upgrade (RU) or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration
is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD
migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains
enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known
password. If the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the
standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service
update, or a new major release of the affected product, this
vulnerability is remediated by that action. Note: Engineering Special
Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard
upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability. An attacker who
can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable
state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow
the attacker to compromise the affected system completely. Cisco Bug

Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to view sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability
exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect
system software version information when the software responds to HTTP
requests that are sent to the web-based interface of the software. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP
requests to the web-based interface of the affected software. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive
information about the software, which the attacker could use to
conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf66155.

A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) ingress
frame-processing functionality of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause one of the LPTS processes on
an affected system to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a brief
denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
incomplete LPTS frame validation by the affected software. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XML requests to
the management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to cause one of the LPTS processes on the
affected system to restart unexpectedly, which would impact LPTS
traffic and cause a brief DoS condition while the process restarts.

to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a heap-based
buffer over-read condition in mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious
file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition or potentially
execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms
of .tar (Tape Archive) files sent to an affected device. A successful
exploit could cause a checksum buffer over-read condition when ClamAV
scans the malicious .tar file, potentially allowing the attacker to
cause a DoS condition on the affected device.

ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute
arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
improper input validation checking mechanisms in the message parsing
function on an affected system. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the
affected device. This action could cause a messageAddArgument (in
message.c) buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious
email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition or
execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to improper input validation checking mechanisms
in mbox.c during certain mail parsing functions of the ClamAV
software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. An
exploit could trigger a NULL pointer dereference condition when ClamAV
scans the malicious email, which may result in a DoS condition.
